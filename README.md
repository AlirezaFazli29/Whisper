# Whisper

Whisper is a pre-trained model for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech translation. Trained on 680k hours of labelled data, Whisper models demonstrate a strong ability to generalise to many datasets and domains without the need for fine-tuning. <br>
Whisper was proposed in the paper Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision by Alec Radford et al. from OpenAI. The original code repository can be found here. <br>

In this project, I used Whisper model to transcribe some farsi sound files and save the transcription of each file in a txt file with the same name of the sound file
